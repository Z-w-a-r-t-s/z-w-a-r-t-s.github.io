## Vulnerability Overview

This challenge demonstrates a **broken access control vulnerability caused by insecure design**. The application trusts client-supplied input to set sensitive user attributes, specifically the `role` parameter during an account upgrade process.

**Key Issues:**
- The application accepts a `role` parameter directly from the client during the upgrade request
- No server-side validation or authorization checks are performed on the role value
- An attacker can intercept the upgrade request and change the role to `administrator`
- The backend blindly accepts the tampered value, granting administrative privileges

This represents a fundamental design flaw where authorization decisions are delegated to the client rather than being enforced server-side.

## Vulnerabilities Covered

- **Broken Access Control** - Unauthorized privilege escalation through parameter manipulation
- **Parameter Tampering** - Modifying the `role` parameter in the upgrade request
- **Insecure Design** - Trusting client input for security-critical role assignment

---

## Classification

- **OWASP Top 10:** A01:2021 - Broken Access Control
- **CWE:** CWE-639 - Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
